# tph

tph is an APL and Befunge inspired 2d array programming language.

**New README _in progress_.**

I decided to take a new approach on the parser, and it seems to work better. But now there are many things to change, including this very README file.

Additionally, I started writing a GUI editor (you can play a little with it in the meanwhile.) There are many things to finish on it yet, but it's working decently already.
